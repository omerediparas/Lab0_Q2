GitHub Assignment 2: Collaboration
For this assignment, you are going to create a tiny Java project with a group of 3-5 students. This group is valid for only this assignment; you do not have to team up with your term project members, but if already found your group, then doing this assignment with your project group is preferred.

Choose one person to create the repository. This person should add other members as collaborators to this repository (On the GitHub page of the remote repository Settings > Collaborators > Add People).
Together, you are going to implement a menu-driven console application that supports the following operations:

- Given an array size, create an int array that contains random integers in the range [0,100]. All the remaining functionality will operate on this array.
- Display the menu options, get the user’s choice, and call the required methods to print out the result. Until the user chooses to exit, you should display the menu again.
- Find the minimum and the maximum of the array; these should be implemented as different methods.
- Find the average of the array. Display how each element of the array differs from the average. For example, if the array is {2, 6, 9, 3, 5}, and the average is 5, then the differences from the average would be {-3, 1, 4, -2, 0}.
- Find the sum of elements with odd- and even-numbered indexes. For example, if the array is {1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 2, 6}, the sum of the odd indexes is 5 + 9 + 2, and the sum of the even indexes is 1 + 8 + 10 + 6, assuming indexes start at 0.

Each person in the group should be responsible for one or more tasks above. You may use different class files if necessary, you need to include a main method to show your working program. You should work on different computers, push your commits to the remote repository and manage merge conflicts when necessary. Each person in the group should have at least one commit to the remote repository, we should be able to see that in the history of the remote repository.
As a group, show the working program and your repository’s commit history to the TA/Tutor in the lab.
